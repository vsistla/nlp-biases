# nlp-biases
This repo is created to show case some of the NLP biases in data and algorithms. 
I am going to review popular NLP datasets to identify potential biases if models are built using those datasets. 

## 1. Book-Crossing Analysis Dataset

### This dataset contains 278,858 users (anonymized but with demographic information) providing 1,149,780 ratings (explicit / implicit) about 271,379 books.
